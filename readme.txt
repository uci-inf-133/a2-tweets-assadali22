Fixed typo in tweet class on activityType for returning meditation. 
Wrote code for getHTMLTableRow (WORKS); now returns the tweet text with the URL
being clickable using match() and replace() string method. Just not sure how to
format the text/table nicely similar to the sample run in assignment description.
Wrote search event handler in descriptions JS (FINALLY WORKING).
Attempted to make a vega bar chart on frequency of activities (NOT WORKING).
